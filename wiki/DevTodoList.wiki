If an !AnimeGroup record is deleted we should also delete and !GroupFilterCondition records which look at that group<br>

With language preferences, allow the user to do a mass rename of groups based on their language preferences. However any groups which have been renamed manually should be excluded<br>

After hashing a file save the filename, size and hash to a new FilenameHash table instead of just sending to the web cache. This should make moving files around a lot less painful.<br>
For users with capable systems, allow them to populate this from the web cache<br>


Move TvDB association to a new table, so that we can more easily show it when displaying details about an anime, not just a series.<br>
AssociatianTvDB<br>
- AssociationSource (int) (WebCache/Personal/TvDB Search - Auto)<br>
- TvDBID (string)<br>
- TvDBSeasonNumber (string)<br>

Move other types of association as well (MAL and MovieDB)<br>
- AssociationType (int)<br>
- AssociationSource (int) (WebCache/Personal)<br>
- AssociationID (string)<br>

MAL - ID<br>
MovieDB - ID<br>
AnimePlanet - ID<br>
BakaBT - URL<br>
AnimeNano - Tag<br>
Crunchyroll<br>

Check whether it is possible to create a report which checks to see if we have v2's of a file. This occurs where a fansub groups releases fixes for a file. usually we want to delete the previous versions of the file<br>
