== Important Notes ==

=== Future Compatibility ===

We will be making an attempt so that the database you used in this Alpha, will also work through to beta until the final release<br>
So hopefully if you will not need to re-import your collection in the future<br>
However this is an Alpha, so no guaranatees can be given at this stage<br>

=== Using !MyAnime3 and !MyAnime2 ===

I recommend that you disable the !MyAnime2 plugin if you are also running JMM Server. Having both running at the same time may cause bans from AniDB<br>

=== Skin Support for !MyAnime3 ===

The alpha current only supports the Avalon skin (http://www.team-mediaportal.com/extensions/widescreen/avalon-skin). If you don't want to use this skin you should wait for the beta instead<br>

== Installation Instructions ==

Current there is no installer, instead you will need to copy the files manually<br>

*Step 1* - Copy the JMMDesktop and JMMServer folder to a choice of your location.<br>

*Step 2* - Copy the `JMMDesktop.exe.config` file to the JMMDesktop folder.<br>

*Step 3* - Copy the `JMMServer.exe.config` file to the JMMServer folder.<br>

*Step 4* - Copy the `MyAnime3\skin\[ Media ]\MyAnime3` folder do your Avalon skin folder Media<br>
`C:\ProgramData\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\skin\Avalon\Media`<br>

*Step 5* - Copy the `MyAnime3\skin\Avalon` folder do your Avalon skin folder <br>
`C:\ProgramData\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\skin\Avalon`

*Step 6* - Copy the `MyAnime3\plugins\Windows` folder do your MP windows plugins folder <br>
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\plugins\Windows`

NOTE - Step 2 and 3 only need to be done the first time. If there are any updates to the alpha, you can cover the folders without the configs<br>

== Running JMM ==

JMM supports both Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and sqlite as the database back-ends<br>
In this alpha not much effort has been put into optimising the sqlite database (this will come later)<br>
Even after sqlite has been improved we recommend that you use SQL server instead (especially if you have over 200 series in your collection)<br>
You can get the free version here  http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=1695<br>

However by default JMM Server is configured to use *sqlite* and will automaticall create the database the first time you start it<br>
If you want to use SQL Server 2008 you will need to do the following

=== Setting up SQL Server 2008 ==

*Step 1* - Install SQL Server 2008<br>

*Step 2* - Create a new database e.g. JMMServer<br>

*Step 3* - Fill out the following settings in `JMMServer.exe.config`<br>

 * `DatabaseType` ('SQLServer')
 * `SQLServer_DatabaseServer` (e.g. 'localhost')
 * `SQLServer_DatabaseName` (e.g. 'JMMServer')
 * `SQLServer_Username` (e.g. 'sa')
 * `SQLServer_Password` (e.g. 'password')


=== Running JMM Server and Desktop ==

*Step 1* - Run JMM Server (You can minimize this if you want)<br>

*Step 2* - Run JMM Desktop

*Step 3* - Go to the settings tab in JMM Desktop and edit the essential settings<br>

*Step 4* - Have a look around and edit any other settings you want to<br>

*Step 5* - Go to the server tab in JMM Desktop, add at least one import folder and then press "Run Import". Note the path must be a valid path on the server<br>

After this you can go to the collection tab, and push the Refresh button. Your series should start appearing after a few minutes<br> 

== Running !MyAnime3 ==

*Step 1* - Run !MediaPortal configuration and go the plugins section<br>

*Step 2* - Optionally list !MyAnime3 in the home screen<br>

*Step 3* - Right Click on !MyAnime and select Configuration<br>

*Step 4* - Test that your connection to JMM Server is working<br>

*Step 5* - Close the config and start !MediaPortal<br>

== Mapping Import Folders on Remote Clients ==

If JMM Desktop or !MyAnime3 is running on a different machine to JMM Server you will need to map share the folders on the server and map them on the client<br>

This is so the client will know how to access the remote files<br>
