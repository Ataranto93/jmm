<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

This page contains notes and instructs for those participating in the JMM Alpha test<br>

== Download ==

Download the Alpha Here<br>

== Using !MyAnime3 and !MyAnime2 ==

I recommend that you disable the !MyAnime2 plugin if you are also running JMM Server. Having both running at the same time may cause bans from AniDB<br>

== Skin Support for !MyAnime3 ==

The alpha current only supports the Avalon skin (http://www.team-mediaportal.com/extensions/widescreen/avalon-skin). If you don't want to use this skin you should wait for the beta instead<br>

== Installation Instructions ==

Current there is no installer, instead you will need to copy the files manually<br>

*Step 1* - Copy the JMMDesktop and JMMServer folder to a choice of your location.<br>

*Step 2* - Copy the JMMDesktop.exe.config file to the JMMDesktop folder.<br>

*Step 3* - Copy the JMMServer .exe.config file to the JMMServer folder.<br>

*Step 4* - Copy the `MyAnime3\skin\[ Media ]\MyAnime3` folder do your Avalon skin folder Media<br>
`C:\ProgramData\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\skin\Avalon\Media`<br>

*Step 5* - Copy the `MyAnime3\skin\Avalon` folder do your Avalon skin folder <br>
`C:\ProgramData\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\skin\Avalon`

*Step 6* - Copy the `MyAnime3\plugins\Windows` folder do your MP windows plugins folder <br>
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\plugins\Windows`

NOTE - Step 2 and 3 only need to be done the first time. If there are any updates to the alpha, you can cover the folders without the configs<br>

== Running JMM ==

*Step 1* - Run JMM Server (You can minimize this if you want)<br>

*Step 2* - Run JMM Desktop

*Step 3* - Go to the settings tab in JMM Desktop and edit the essential settings<br>

*Step 4* - Have a look around and edit any other settings you want to<br>

*Step 5* - Go to the server tab in JMM Desktop, add at least one import folder and then press "Run Import". Note the path must be a valid path on the server<br>

After this you can go to the collection tab, and push the Refresh button. Your series should start appearing after a few minutes<br> 

== Running !MyAnime3 ==

*Step 1* - Run !MediaPortal configuration and go the plugins section<br>

*Step 2* - Optionally list !MyAnime3 in the home screen<br>

*Step 3* - Right Click on !MyAnime and select Configuration<br>

*Step 4* - Test that your connection to JMM Server is working<br>

*Step 5* - Close the config and start !MediaPortal<br>

== Mapping Import Folders on Remote Clients ==

If JMM Desktop or !MyAnime3 is running on a different machine to JMM Server you will need to map share the folders on the server and map them on the client<br>

This is so the client will know how to access the remote files<br>
