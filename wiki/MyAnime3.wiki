==Continue Watching==

The 'Continue Watching' window is designed to make your viewing experience a bit easier. It will only show you series that you have already started watching, and where you have unwatched episodes.<br>

==Recommendations==

The recommendations windows does two things<br>
*Recommendations to Download* - anime that you don't have in your collection<br> 
*Recommendations to Watch* - anime that you have in your collection but haven't started watching<br>

Both types are based on how you have voted/rating your existing series on AniDB. It then takes suggestions by other AniDB users and compiles a list for you<br>
