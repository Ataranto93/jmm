== Introduction ==

The File Renaming tab allows you to configure how you would like to rename your files (optional of course)<br>

It allows you to set up a profile to automatically rename your files as they are imported into your collection, or rename files already in your collection<br>

The renaming functionality provided is a subset of the functionality provided by WebAOM, with some modifications
