= Why upgrade to JMM and !MyAnime3 =

<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

This page is intended for users of !MyAnime2<br>
It will help you decide whether it worth upgrading from !MyAnime2 to JMM/!MyAnime3<br>

== Generic Files ==

== Multiple Clients ==

JMM has a central server component which manages a shared database (and also does all the hashing of files etc).<br>
!MyAnime3 and JMM clients connect to this server to get all information. This means that you can run more than one instance of !MediaPortal/!MyAnime3 without needing to double up on databases or hash files on each instance<br>

== Multiple Users ==

You can now create multiple users when starting !MyAnime3 / JMM Client or any other client<br>
Each individual user provides the following advantages<br>
- Separate episode watched states<br>
- Separate favorites<br>
- Filtering on groups by category/genre<br>
